Mapbox Voice Guidance Generator

The Mapbox Voice Guidance Generator Project
------------------------------------------

This project aims to facilitate the creation of voice guidance files, enhancing the voice guidance feature within [Dragonpilot](https://github.com/dragonpilot-community/dragonpilot/tree/beta3).

## How It Functions

When Dragonpilot is operational and utilizes the Navigation feature from [Openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot), the Mapbox direction [icons](https://github.com/mapbox/directions-icons) are visibly presented on the screen.

The core concept involves generating a comprehensive collection of voice files, each corresponding to specific direction icons. Additionally, a series of voice files are generated to indicate distances for upcoming turns.

Ultimately, by sequentially playing the "distance voice" followed by the "direction voice," the voice guidance feature becomes fully functional.
